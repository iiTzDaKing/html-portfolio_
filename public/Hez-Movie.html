<h1>Hezekiah's Top Movies</h1>

<p>The best movies according to beginner web developer, but veteran nerd, Hezekiah Yamamoto.</p>

<h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
<p>This film is a masterpiece. I've seen the film over 50 times, every time discovery something new. The movie is dark and gritty, while not compromising on the morality of the hero, as many films try to do nowadays. Despite Christian Bale delivering an excellent performance as the Caped Crusader, it is Heath Ledgers Joker that truly steals the show. He is truly the definition of the meme; "Never let them know your next move." Overall the film gets a 1000/10 and is my favorite movie of all time.</p>

<h2>Wall-E</h2>
<p>They say in film making that you should always show, and not tell. This movie took that advice seriously and as a result is in my opinion Pixar's Magnum Opus. This heartwarming story about a little robot falling in love seems very silly at first, but grows into to something that has captured the hearts and minds of everyone that has watched it. This film gets a 100/10 from me, and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.</p>
