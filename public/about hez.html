<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just a young guy trying to make a career in Web Development. I love my God, I love my wife, and I love solving problems. 
  Using my brain in a way that helps, and adds comfort and convience to myself, as well as to those around me sounds like an 
  excellent use of my time. Coding is more than just a source of income for me. It's something that I have legitimately been 
  enjoying for a while now, and I always do my best work when I enjoy what I do.
</p>

<p>Outside of coding, the things that I enjoy are spending time with my family and friends, working on my '07 BMW 335i, 
  cooking, and playing videogames.</p>
